mid-term project by node.js and raspberry pi
The concept of this project is to help people get motivated to post something on social media by combining gamification with traditional Japanese pilgrimage . 
In this product, I used a Raspberry pi for a server and Parse to manage data. For the input, twitter activities that include being mentioned, favorited and getting a new follower are recorded. 
For the output, a web page shows how many twitter activities you have got so far by retrieving data from Parse and visualizing the data in a meter.
You can watch a video that demonstrates how it works at https://vimeo.com/145278731
